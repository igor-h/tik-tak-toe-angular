I've created a Tic-Tac-Toe game following the Angular v20 best practices. 
Here's what I'll implement:

Features:

- [ ] Player Name Input: Both players enter their names before the game starts
- [ ] Current Player Display: Top left corner shows whose turn it is (with X or O marker)
- [ ] Score Tracking: Top right corner displays wins for each player
- [ ] Responsive Game Board: 3x3 grid with smooth interactions
- [ ] Win Detection: Checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins
- [ ] Draw Detection: Detects when the board is full with no winner
- [ ] Play Again: Reset the board while keeping scores
- [ ] New Game: Reset everything including player names and scores

Styling with Tailwind CSS v4.1:

- [ ] Gradient backgrounds
- [ ] Hover effects and transitions
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Card-based layout with shadows
- [ ] Color-coded players (purple for Player 1/X, pink for Player 2/O)

Angular Best Practices Applied:

- [ ] Signals for state management
- [ ] Standalone component architecture
- [ ] Change detection optimization
- [ ] Pure functions for game logic
- [ ] Single responsibility principle
